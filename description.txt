This mod provides the Nuka-World package for The Cheat Bunker and connects The Bunker to the Nuka-World world space.  As such, it requires both the Nuka-World DLC and The Cheat Bunker to be installed.  This package brings the armor and weapons from Nuka-World into The Cheat Bunker and comes with a few Quest Autocompletion options.  These options are:
 - Unlocking the Nuka-World Red Rocket settlement without completing the DLC
 - Unlocking all the Nuka-World robot workbench parts
 - Collecting all the Star Cores during the quest “Star Control”
 - Finding all the hidden clues during the quest “Cappy in a Haystack”
